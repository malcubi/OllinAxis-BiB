! ***   FILE FOR ARRAY DECLARATION   ***
! **************************************

!               VERY IMPORTANT  (PLEASE READ)
!
! * Comments must be preceded by exclamation marks (like in Fortran).
!
! * Declare only one array per line.
!
! * Control statements for each array are indicated in a comment,
!   and MUST include the following keywords:
!
!   SYMMETRYR, SYMMETRYZ, INTENT, STORAGE
!
!   Notice that they must always come in this order, and they
!   must be separated by commas.
!
! * The keywords SYMMETRY* can have one of the following values:
!
!   SYMMETRY* = +1       The variable is even.
!                        (no space is allowed between + and 1)
!
!   SYMMETRY* = -1       The variable is odd.
!                        (no space is allowed between - and 1)
!
!   SYMMETRY* =  0       The variable will NOT be touched when
!                        updating the symmetries.
!
! * The keyword INTENT can have one of the following values:
!
!   INTENT = EVOLVE      The array is a main dynamical variable
!                        and will be updated during the evolution
!                        loop.  For each array of this type named
!                        "var", three extra arrays will be created:
!
!                        var_p = previous time level
!                        svar  = source term for evolution
!                        var_a = auxiliary array
!
!   INTENT = AUXILIARY   The array is not one of the main evolved variables,
!                        but can contain other important variables (derivatives,
!                        curvature components, etcetera).
!
!   INTENT = OUTPUT      The array will be calculated for output,
!                        so memory will only be allocated if we want
!                        output for this array.
!
!   INTENT = POINTER     This array is actually a pointer.  They are
!                        declared with STORAGE always, but they are
!                        not actually allocated.
!
!   INTENT = ELLIPTIC    Similar to EVOLVE, but intended for "internal"
!                        iterations in an elliptic solver.
!
! * The keyword STORAGE can have one of the following values:
!
!   STORAGE = ALWAYS            Storage for this variable is always on.
!                               If the variable is of type OUTPUT this
!                               means it will be on when we need output.
!
!   STORAGE = CONDITIONAL(*)    In this case storage will be conditional
!                               on the condition inside the parenthesis.
!                               Notice that the condition must be a correctly
!                               formatted Fortran logical statement involving
!                               one of the parameters of the code (see e.g. shift).
!
! * The keyword ONELEVEL, when present, indicates that the array has only one
!   grid level.  This is useful for example for the synchronization pointer.
!
! * The keyword NOBOUND, when present, indicates that an evolving array has no
!   need for a boundary condition since its source can be calculated all the way
!   to the boundary.
!
! * The keyword NOSYNC, when present, indicates that the array should not be
!   sunchronized either across processors or across grids when they intersect.
!
! * The keyword ZEROD, when present, indicates that the "array" is not really an
!   array but rather just a global real variable. This is useful, for example,
!   when integrating the background in a cosmological spacetime.
!
! * The keyword CHECKPOINT, when present, indicates that this array should be saved
!   at checkpoint time even if it does not evolve.
